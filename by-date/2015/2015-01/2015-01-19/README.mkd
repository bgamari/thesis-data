Looking at ionic strength dependence of Oregon Green 488 in PIPES

1uM dye concentration, varying buffer up to 150mM ionic strenght
Adding further salt with varying NaCl concentration

 * run000: IRF off empty well

Power: 31uW @ 488nm

 * run001: IS=1mM, pH 6 PIPES
 * run002: IS=10mM, pH 6 PIPES
 * run003: IS=50mM, pH 6 PIPES
 * run004: IS=200mM, pH 6 PIPES
 * run005: IS=400mM, pH 6 PIPES
 * run006: IS=800mM, pH 6 PIPES, very little fluorescence
