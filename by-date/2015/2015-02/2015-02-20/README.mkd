# 2015-02-21: FCS on droplets

The last several attempts at performing FCS on droplets have failed
due to laser fluctuations (correlations out at Ï„~1 second) and high
droplet concentrations

See Ben #4 pg. 15

 * run000: 2nM Oregon Green 514
 * run001: Uncorrelated light

Let's look at 50uM Oregon Green 488 in Citrate 5.5 with reduced
aqueous volume in emulsion stock (2 uL)

 * run002: 2uL of 50uM OG488 + Citrate 5.5 in 200uL 2% Raindance/FC-40
 * run003: Again
 * run004: Again, throw away past t=175 seconds; opened door too early

Now let's try the usual 5uL aqeous volume,

 * run005: 5uL of 50uM OG488 + Citrate 5.5 in 200uL 2% Raindance/FC-40
 * run006: Again

Lowered power to unknown

 * run007: Again
 * run008: Again

This looks pretty good, let's retry the surfactant concentration
series experiment attempted on 2015-02-10 and 2015-02-12

Use 2uL aqueous phase in 200uL [0.1%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%]
Raindance/FC-40

 * run009, run010, run011, run012: 1.0%
 * run013, run014, run015, run016: 0.5%
 * run017, run018, run019, run020: 0.1%
 * run021, run022, run023, run024: 1.5%
 * run025, run026, run027, run028: 2.0%

 * run29, run030: 2nM OG514
