Taking data on tracked droplets.
10nM single-stranded DNA with Cy3 labels
110uW excitation (measured at after cleanup filter)

001: No notes

002: Droplet slightly less than 1um diam.
     A few hundred counts in each channel
     Lost track at t=212 sec
        
Switched to 100nM DNA

003: Large droplet, perhaps 2um diam.
     Large fluorescence signal although transient
     350-400 photons/sec
     Perhaps track needs to be tighter?
     Increase focal volume?
     Lost track at t=330
     Strange burst of fluorescence as it clamped

004: Smaller droplets, ~1um
     Not as many "bursts", shorter
     Maximum peak ~ 40 photons/10ms
     300 donor photons/sec
     Stopped due to poor signal at t=300s

005: Another 1um droplet
     Again, short bursts
     Lost track after 40sec

006: 1um droplet
     Saw 100 photon/10ms burst around t=70s
     Stopped due to poor signal at t=450s

007: 1-2um droplet
     Around 115s intensity increased for ~10s
     Clamped around t=145s

008: 1um droplet
     Some clear bursts
     t=301: Several 100photon/10ms bursts
     t=329: 600 photons/10ms
     Very active fluorescence
     Clamped around t=520s

Clearly we can collect (some) fluorescence from
droplets while tracking. What now?

* Ensure tracking and fluorescence beams are
  cofocal
* Play around with tracking setpoint?
* Need to improve track or increase focal volume
  size?
* Decrease IR background (filters coming)
* Make operation smoother
* Surfactant (Triton) is suboptimal

Goal: (Near) constant burst rates

Once this has been achieved we can try a FRET
experiment
