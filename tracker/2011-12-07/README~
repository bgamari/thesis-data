Spent all day working on new amplifier
  - Implemented filters correctly
  - Added offset compensation to sum signals, allowing for increased gain

Results look quite promising

001: 500nm fluorescent bead in 75% glycerine
     Started recording timetags several minutes into track
     Very robust track, largest singular value = 0.096
     Looking at position trace one can see oscillations
     Feedback too strong?
     See definite photobleaching over time
     From 13k/s to 9k/s over 15 minutes
     Lost at timetag t=712s, track t~1000s
     Signal immediately dropped to 7k/s but persisted at this intensity for quite a while
     Persisted even after moving stage
     I guess this is background
     Damn, forgot to save tracker trajectory

Done with calibration and testing
Taking data on Ha's oligo A and D, 100nM with PCD, PCA, and trolox

002: Yesterday's DNA sample
     Very large droplet
     200/s donor, 150/s acceptor
     Lost at t=104s

003: Small droplet. Nothing present

004: Slightly less than 1um droplet
     Background counts except for a spurious burst in donor channel

005: Similar sized droplet
     Falloff in acceptor after during first second
     Peker thinks that this couldn't have been lamp

006: Spurious burst in acceptor just as we declared it empty
     Lost track after 45s

007: Large yet empty?
     Nope, burst at t=25s in acceptor

008: Something in here
     Started with AOTF Amp=300
     Changed to 500 at t~40s
     Changed to 1000 at t=76s
     Definitely saw several seconds of events followed by "bleaching"
     150+ counts/10ms
     Mostly donor
     Several shorter bursts after this.
     Large burst at t=223s
     Another at t=239, 245, etc.
     t=283s, >250/10ms
     Many more bursts
     Lost track at t=580s
     Still more events

Modulating laser with AOTF on/off, Amp=1000
Tracker feedback rate=350Hz

009: Turned on laser at t=13s
     Immediately saw events
     Things died down around t=30
     More events
     Lost track at t=75s

010: Turned on laser at t=15s
     Immediate increase in baseline intensity to 300/s donor
     Many events, some with >300/10ms
     Lost track at t~200s, didn't notice until t~500s

011: Turned on laser at t=10
     Strong signal for a few seconds, then more or less died
     Again lost track (t=130s) without our noticing

012: Turned on laser at t=14s
     Again strong signal decaying to nothing
     Lost at t=28s

013: Turn on again obvious
     Lost at t=40s

014: Turn on at t=9s
     Relatively little change
     Lost at t=119s, large burst

015: Large signal at turn-on
     Usual steady stream of bursts
     Lost at t=448s

016: Again, large signal at turn-on, quickly decaying back to near background
     Let's try reducing power
     Amp=700 at t=118s
     Noticeable reduction in background

Enough looking at bursts
Let's look at the turn-on period
Start with power dependence

017: Start with amp=200
     Turned on at t=15?
     Turned off at t=38?
     Amp=500
     Turned on a t=60
     There's likely nothing in here

018: Start with amp=400
     Turnon at t=9s
     No change
     At t=31 set amp=1000
     Large response, decayed
     Bursts
     Given the timing and magnitude of the response, it seems that high amplitudes affect response in nonlinear way?
     Killed laser at t=200s
     Turned on again at t=210s
     turned off at t=220s
     turned on with amp=800 at t=230s
     Lost at t=310s


019: Start at amp=700
     Laser on at t=15s
     Perhaps a longer decay than with higher powers?
     Bursts
     Turned off laser at t=100s
     Turned on at t=120s
     No change? WTF
     Bursts
     Lost track at t=293s

Still no idea what is happening during turn-on
Let's try modulating laser during turn-on
We turn on laser, see beginning of decay, turn off
Turn on again after some time
One of three things could happen:
  a) Recovers: Intensity returns to value it started decay at (unlikely)
  b) Continues: Intensity picks up at the value it decayed to
  c) Nothing: It has died despite laser being off

Use timetag_seq to modulate laser: 100ms on, 100ms off
amp = 700

020: Laser on at t=7
     See clear modulation
     Decays gradually
     See bursts and background modulated
     Stopped at t=135s

021: amp=500, modulated
     Laser on at t=12s, no change
     Change to amp=700 at t=33s
     now we see signal, modulated as expected
     Stopped at t=135s

Strange, amp=500 we see nothing, amp=700 we see signal
Spot clearly visible on optics at amp=500
AOTF freq=70.950
Despite this, power meter claims,

        amp     power
        500     0.1uW == 0
        600     1.1uW
        650     2.3uW
        700     3.6uW
        750     6.2uW
        800     8.5uW
        850     11.9uW
        900     15uW
        950     17.9uW
        1000    22uW

Output at laser aperture measured to be 370uW at fiber coupling with amp=950
Fiber coupling efficiency = 5%, must be misaligned
I guess that explains it
