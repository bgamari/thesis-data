Looking at droplets to verify track quality

21.8uW power in green channel

Used sample of 100nM Cy3-labelled oligo for alignment
See Peker's notebook (pg. ) for prep

Looking at 10uM TMR sample in droplets
Peker aimed for larger droplets, see Peker's FRET notebook 3, pg. 30
We'll look at droplets in the range of 1 to 3um in diameter


001: Lost at t=15s
     More spurious counts than we would like
     Bursts of 300/10ms quite common

002: Started at 2500 counts/10ms
     Decayed nicely to 100/10ms by t=60s
     Interesting blip at t=68s
     Continues to decay but seeing quite large bursts (t=104s)
     50 counts/10ms baseline
     Stopped tracking at t=140s

003: Excitation on at t=18s
     Started at 2600 counts/10ms
     Decayed to 200/10ms by t=30s
     Lost track at t=74s

004: On at t=11s
     Started at 500/10ms
     Decay to 100/10ms by t=30s
     Lost track at t=105s

So, we can clearly see decay, although it would be nice if the decay lifetime were a bit longer
We'll try the same experiment with PCA/PCD/trolox tomorrow

We'll next try 1uM TMR in even larger droplets (>3um, as produced by Peker this weekend)
The goal is to try doing FCS

Tried a very large droplet, >600k counts/s
Gave up on this one

Power = 18.5uW

005: ~5um droplet
     Started off at 500k/s
     Decayed down to 12k/s
     Stopped at t=275s

Given decay, it seems unlikely we'll be able to get a reasonable FCS signal
Reduced power to 0.6uW (on background of <0.1uW)

006: ~5um droplet
     Started at 6000/s
     Decayed and then increased
     Hmm, decayed to 300/s at t=80s yet still tracking
     Stopped fluorescence aquisition
     It seems we weren't tracking

Reduce power a bit further to 0.2uW

007: 5um droplet
     1300/s
     Lost at 54s
     No appreciable decay

008: 5um droplet
     22k/s donor, 2300/s acceptor
     Too large for FCS?
     Stopped at 4e6 photons due to high intensity
     No appreicable decay

009: 3um droplet
     1400/s donor, 220/s acceptor
     Lost track around t=520s
     Gathered ~500k photons total
     
010: 3um droplet
     3600/s donor, 460/s acceptor
     Seems to be increasing?
     By t=120s, seems to be around 5000/s
