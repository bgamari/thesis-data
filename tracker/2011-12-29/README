#DPower=0.2uW, amp=507

IR beam was quite far from visible
Optimized IR alignment to be confocal with visible with fluorescent beads

Moving to DNA sample

#DPower=1uW, amp=560
Tried numerous times to track, failed

Just trying to take diffusive FRET data

#DPower=20uW, amp=770
#APower=10uW, amp=110

Starting with ALEX, 50us/50us

001: Large bursts, many with no acceptor response


002:
        No ALEX this time
        Also large bursts
        Perhaps slightly larger than before

Let's ensure that our signal isn't just the buffer or surfactant
Trying FRET on droplet sample containing only HEPES, PCD, PCA, Trolox

003: No ALEX
004: ALEX, 50us, 50us
