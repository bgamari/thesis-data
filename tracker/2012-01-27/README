## Playing around with buffer, O2 scavenging system ##

Peker realized that Trolox's efficacy is severely hampered by our buffer and the lack of O2
Trolox is a ROXS system which depends upon photo-induced dissocciation by oxygen to supply a reducer
Since we replace O2 with CO2 there is no reducer in the system therefore we much add it
Trolox, reducer: 2mM

First tests showed extremely "blinky" results

Doubling trolox and reducer concentration while halfing PCA concentration greatly improved results

2000 donor/s with 0.1-0.2uW (amp=250)

## No Oxidizer, No CO2, 10nM DNA ##

Power: Donor: 0.1uW (amp=250)
       Acceptor: 0.1uW (amp=40)

001: Quite blinky
     Donor increased with acceptor death
     Difficult to determine how many molecules
     Stopped track at t=95s

002: High donor before acceptor started blinking
     Lost track at t=28s

003: Lamp decay at t=6s
     One acceptor bleach at t=43s
     Lost track at t=180s

## No Oxidizer, CO2, 10nM DNA ##

004: Definite difference, Effectively no blinking
     Donor died at t=34s
     Came back 10s later?
     Killed track at t=72s

005: Empty

006: Occassional small bursts

007: Donor only?
     Stopped track at t=54s

008: Empty

009: Very strong signal
     Perhaps three molecules
     Lost track at t=292s

010: Empty

011: Empty

012: Empty

013: Empty

014: Empty

015: Finally, a signal
     Two or three molecules


## Oxidizer, No CO2, 10nM DNA ##

016: Very nice, long acceptor signal
     Signal dropped out at t=96s
     Came back at t=103s
     Acceptor died at t=132s

017: Empty

018: Larger droplet, 3um?
     1000 acceptor/s, 600 donor/s
     Several molecules
     Lost track at t=189s

019: Single molecule?
     Killed track at t=132s

Power: Donor: 1uW (amp=534)

020: Empty

021: Empty

022: Empty

023: Empty

024: On at t=31s
     Slight glow in acceptor

025: Empty

026: Empty

027: Empty

028: Empty

029: Finally
     Acceptor: 1200/s
     Donor: 800/s
     Bleached quickly

030: Acceptor: 900/s
     Donor: 500/s
     Very discrete acceptor death at t=98
     Donor dies a few seconds later

031: Faint acceptor signal
     Killed excitation at t=76s

032: Donor-only
     Donor died at t=48s

033: Empty

## Oxidizer, CO2, 10nM DNA ##

Power: Donor: 0.1uW (amp=250)

034: Long-lived acceptor
     Died at t=88s

035: Lost trace at t=242s

Power : Donor: 1uW (amp=534)

036: Several donor only?

037: Empty

038: Empty

039: Blinky and dim
     Lost track at t=168s, got brighter
     hmmm, looks like we still have some alignment to do
