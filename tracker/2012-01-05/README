Oligo A, D, 10nM
Double conc. PCA, PCD
Trolox

Three empties discarded

001: Sent at t=31s
     Lost track at t=34s

002: Empty

003: On at t=62s
     Only lasted for a few seconds
     Donor persisted
     Two donor bleaches, final at t=102s
     Very good track, killed with stage

004: Another fast acceptor death
     Quench at t=55s
     Triplet blinking thereafter?
     Everything dead at t=78s

005: On at t=8s
     Only one acceptor quaench at t=12s
     Donor died at t=142s

006: 1s-long acceptor

007: Sent at t=7s
     Long-lived
     two-molecules
     last acceptor bleach at t=19s

008: Single molecule
     ~5s long acceptor

009: Empty

010: Empty

011: Two acceptors lived for 10, 19 seconds
     Stopped due to boredom
     Still likely one living donor
     
012: Centered over droplet, didn't track
     Started excitation at t=6s
     Saw donor decay, ran rough calibration
     Saw burst at t=8.5s

013: Empty

014: Empty

015: Single molecule
     No donor?

016: Empty

017: Empty

018: Empty
