DNA Oligo A, D
50nM
Droplets with minimal 

Power: Amp=500 (~10uW)

001: Saw acceptor decay

Can't find any more in this sample, new sample

002: Large droplet
     Long decay
     Far more than one molecule
     Very slow donor decay
     Stopped track around t=120s

003: Another larger droplet but smaller than 002
     Faster acceptor and donor decay?
     t=87s, t=99s: bleach events
     Very nice series of bleaches
     Final donor bleach at t=257s

Power: Amp320 (~0.1uW)
Another new sample
Doubled PCD, PCA concentration
Five minute sonication
004: Another larger droplet
     A couple seconds of reasonable data before acceptor bleached
     Stopped track at t=111s

005: Much stronger signal
     Acceptor died within 30s
     Killed track at t=111s

Perhaps the acceptor's early death is the result of IR
IR power: from laser: 2.17W
Let's try looking at droplet on surface without IR

006: See red, perhaps it's from the glass?
     Doesn't seem to be decaying
     At t=586s increased power to amp=650 (10uW)
     700/s
     Still no decay
     At t=730s increased power to amp=860 (100uW
     1200/s
     Still no decay

Seems likely we were just seeing from the 

Let's try top surface
Power: amp=150 (0.1uW)
007: Starts off at 30/10ms acceptor
     Reasonable decay
     Suddenly lost signal at t=45s
     Partially regained a few seconds later
     Similar fluctuations continued

Let's try this again with IR for comparison
008: Start at 10/10ms
     Definitely faster decay than 007
     No donor though, odd

009: Nothing until t=36
     Weird

010: More strange fluctuations
     Eventually back to background counts

Droplet was quite far from our starting point
Perhaps piezo stage is drifting
Killed tracker

011: Fluctuations
     Eventually back to background counts

Quite inconclusive
Refocused in Z
Try another without IR

012: Strong acceptor signal
     Slow decay, no fluctuations
     Increased power to 1000 at t=196 to bleach remaining donor
     Killed excitation at t=262s

This definitely points towards IR having effect on photophysics
Let's try IR again

013: Also strong acceptor signal
     Difficult to tell whether decay is faster or slower than 012
     Nice decay, however, so a fit could tell us

Judging by decay curves, IR has little effect on decay time
Halflife ~ 50s in both cases

Looking back at 2011-12-22:
  0.2uW results in halflife of ~50s
  1.0uW results in halflife of ~15s
  10uW results in halflife of ~1s
  
In summary,
  Lifetime scaling appears to be consistent with intuition
  IR has little effect (insufficient power for multiple photon excitation)
  PCD/PCA is working?
  Five minute sonication time is sufficient for droplets yet doesn't melt DNA
  At 0.1uW, acceptor lifetime is probably acceptable for FRET study
  Will this intensity be sufficient for single-molecule study?
