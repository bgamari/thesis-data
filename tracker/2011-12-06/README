Doing FRET experiments in trapped droplets
10nM doubly labelled DNA in HEPES buffer, pH=7.8

Having great difficulty tracking
Signal appears much weaker than usual
Took out first IR ND=2 filter

001: Saw several series of brief bursts in both channels
     Up to 200 counts/10ms.
     FRET?
     Lost track at t=169s
     Several spurious events after lost track

002: Again, sparse bursts

003: No counts until t=580s
     Sporatic bursts in acceptor
     Lost at t=612

004: Brightfield tail at beginning
     A few scattered hits
     Lost at t=120s
     Still see consistent bursts

005: Much more frequent bursts than previous droplets
     Lost track at t=52s

006: Lost immediately on switchover

007: Small
     Probably nothing in there
     Lost track after 70s

008: High counts
     donor: 280/s, acceptor: 100/s
     Lost at t=62s
     Interesting, acceptor counts rose after loss of track

009: donor: 120/s, acceptor: 70/s
     a few bursts
     Lost at t=62s

Switching to new sample, this time with PCA and PCD for O2 scavaging

010: Very few events until track last at t=90s

011: Large drop

Really just don't have enough sensitivity in Z
Electronics work necessary
