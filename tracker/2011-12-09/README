Realign of APDs with Cy3

Realign IR/visible with fluorescent beads
Power = 1uW
AOTF Amp = 600
27kcounts/s when we started alignment
Seemed to decay a bit, bleaching?
20kcounts/s after alignment

Power = 11uW
AOTF Amplitude = 800

Data on Ha's DNA, 100nM, doubly-labelled
Using PCA, PCD (both newly prepared)

001:  ~1um droplet
      Start out with ~200/10ms
      See first burst at t=582s
      Increased power from amp=600 to amp=800 at t=601s
      Immediate increase in signal
      Decay
      Lost track somewhere around 920s
      Acceptor signal increased to 1100/s
      Donor decreased to 200/s
      No change 
      Usual bursts
      Stopped acquisition at t=1118s

Lori suggested alternating in red to potentially kick dye out of dark state
10ms/10ms alternation

002: Very short data set
     Saw acceptor decay
     Quickly lost track

003: Again, saw acceptor decay
     Then modulated bursts
     Lost at t=324s

Clearly there is something which we don't understand here
The bursts have no obvious explanation
Lori suggests doing FCS on a concentrated Cy3 sample
Peker prepared 100nM Cy3 droplet sample

004: Chose larger droplet
     See consistent 20% leakage of donor into acceptor channel
     Similar bursts as we saw in double-stranded case
     More of them?
     Lost track at t=188s
     Still see consistent bursts
     Recentered tracker at t=250s
     Took 1.6M photons

Looking at correlation function, it seems the we have something resembling a diffusive process, tau~40ms
With \eta=24, \omega=200nm this corresponds to 50nm droplet
Can't be true

It seems we might be too close to the top surface
Let's move further into soloution

005: Didn't bother tracking
     Collected 1.4M photons

Looks very similar to 004
Let's try beads
50nm red beads, diluted 1e5 times from stock with 70% glycerol (v/v)

006: aotf amp=550, should be around 1uW
     500 donor counts/s
     Correlation function signal was too weak
     Gave up after 700 seconds

Try more dilute sample, less viscous, 50% glycerol (v/v)

007: aotf amp=650
     500 counts/s 

from preliminary fits, it seems that 007's tau~350us. This is far less than what I would expect from a 50nm bead.

Peker made sample with 60% glycerine and 10x more dilute in beads

008: aotf amp=800
     bursts very much like the droplets
     more dense
     600-1200 counts/sec
     
To summarize (by eye),

        datum   tau     notes
        004     23ms    unknown sizes, 24 centipoise
        005     32ms    24 centipoise
        007     460us   0.1 centipoise, 50nm beads
        008     745us   0.4 centipoise, 50nm beads

According to 008, the beam waist is 45nm. This can't be right.
