2011-12-20: Ben and Peker, Ha Oligo A and D


== Sample #1 ==

Looking at Ha's DNA, oligo A, oligo D in droplets
FC-40 with Triton
No Trolox, PCA, PCD due to misunderstanding
See Peker's FRET notebook, pg. 33

=== FRET, no ALEX ===

Power: donor: 20uW

001: 3um droplet?
     Acceptor started at 200/10ms to settle at 10/10ms
     Donor went from 
     Settled at donor 250/s, acceptor 100/s
    
=== ALEX ===

Power: donor: 10uW (amp=785)
       acceptor: 5.5uW (amp=62)

Using ALEX with : 50us, 50us

002: Slightly larger than 1um droplet?
     Nothing

003: Started at 20/10ms donor, 5/10ms acceptor
     Donor only with crosstalk?
     No appreciable bleaching?
     Lost track at t=87s, no idea why
     Signal increased to 100/10ms right after loss

004: Donor: 90/10ms
     Acceptor decayed from 80/10ms down to 10/10ms within 20s
     Slow decay of donor to
     Perhaps a bleach event in donor at t=75s
     Another around t=120s

005: 1um droplet
     Donor: 20/10ms
     Acceptor: 50/s
     Acceptor decayed, donor rose
     Acceptor died off, looking at donor only
     Fluctuations in donor intensity
     Bleach around t=128s
     Another around t=160s?
     Stopped at t=210s

006: donor: 100/10ms
     acceptor 500/10ms
     acceptor died within 15s, donor rises
     donor again slowly decays
     Stopped at t=120s

=== FRET, no ALEX ===
One more without ALEX

007: acceptor: 140/s
     donor 50/s
     acceptor decayed within 12s, donor rose
     Background counts by t=90s

=== For fun ===

Peker is taking a break and will prepare a new sample
I'll take a few sets on my own for fun
Let's try some long timescale variants on ALEX
With ALEX: 10ms, 10ms

008: Lamp decay
     Turned on excitation at t~15s
     Very fast acceptor decay
     Forgot to close door

009: The usual pattern
     Killed track at t=188s

Remeasured power
        Donor: 10uW
        Acceptor: 5uW

== Sample 2 ==
Another Oligo A, D sample
This time with Trolox, PCD, PCA

=== FRET, no ALEX ===
010: ~3um droplet?
     Didn't catch beginning counts
     Substantially more intense than anything seen thusfar
     Settles at similar count rate to previous empty droplets
     Quite abrupt bleach near end?
     Track still seems to be working

011: Acceptor: 15/10ms
     Donor: 7/10ms
     Acceptor decays, donor remains steady
     Waiting to reproduce abrupt bleach as seen in 010
     Seems to smoothly decay down to background
     Stopped track at t=256s
     
012: Acceptor: 30/10ms, decay by t=14s
     Donor: 15/10ms
     Stopped track at t=92s

=== ALEX ===

ALEX: 50us, 50us

013: Didn't catch beginning counts
     Acceptor decay slower
     Lost tracking t=121s

014: Acceptor: 325/10ms
     Donor came up as usual
     Lost track at t=15.5s

015: Acceptor: 20/10ms
     Donor came up as usual
     at t=120: donor=120/s, aceptor=60/s
     Let's try to bleach remaining
     at t=138 increased amp=1000
     Didn't see bleach but clearly there was a drop in donor intensity after amp was reduced back to 785

=== ALEX with reduced power ===

Clearly we see FRET but acceptor is too short lived
Let's reduce power
Power:
        Donor: 1uW (amp=590)
        Acceptor: 0.54uW (amp=20)

016: Acceptor: 250/bin
     Longer acceptor decay (18s)
     Large fluctuations in donor intensity, reflected in acceptor
     Lost track at t=95s

017: Smallish droplet
     No real signal but still above background
     Killed track at t=62s

018: No signal
     Killed track at t=36s

019: Acceptor: 8/10ms
     Donor: 2/10ms
     Everything gone before t=30s

020: Very little fluorescence

021: Light on at t=13s
     Again little fluorescence
     Try increasing power back to donor=10uW, acceptor=5uW
     Incrased acceptor at t=58s
     No change
     donor at t=69s
     Saw increase in donor
     Nothing else interesting

=== FRET, no ALEX, reduced power ===
Go back to 1uW donor excitation
No ALEX
It's getting difficult to find large (>1um) droplets so we've been looking primarily at smaller specimens

022: Acceptor: 11/10us
     Decayed
     Lost at t=27s, large increase in intensity near end
     It seems that we are likely out of alignment

023: Acceptor: 6/10us
     Killed track

024: Acceptor: 3/10us
     Tried various twiddling of Z setpoint
     No effect at all, clearly I need to look at the setpoint code

Very little signal
Looks like we need to look at the alignment

== Buffer droplet sample ==

Water, trolox, pca, pcd at standard concentration in FC-40
Hoping to verify lack of fluorescence by buffer

Same power as before (10uW, 1uW)
No ALEX

025: Sent to APDs at t=10s
     Excitation light at t=14s
     Pretty much no added background
     Lost feedback at t=238s

026: Not tracking droplet
     Looking at oil alone
     
027: Not tracking droplet
     Looking at oil along
     IR off
