0.5 micron beads in 75% glycerine solution for calibration of
beams and characterization of fluorescence during tracking


001: Optimizing beams to be cofocal
     Tried moving IR beam, lost track

IR quite far from visible
Realigned beams

002: Brief data collection while tracking
     10uW, 600kphotons/sec

003: Another brief track
     1uW, 60kphotons/sec
     Lost after ~15s
     Dropped to 15k/s

004: 1uW, 75kphotons/sec
     Fluctuates over course of tens of seconds from 80k to 40k
     Lost at t=103s
     Dropped to 12k/s

005: Around 90k/s
     Lost at t=105s
     Again dropped to 12k/s

006: Trapped bead
     22k/s

Move to droplets with 100nM single-stranded DNA, Cy3 labelled

007: Large-ish droplet, 2um?
     10k/s in donor, 2k/s in acceptor
     Tapers off slowly
     Lost track at 69s
     Back to 50/s background

008: 0.5um-1um droplet?
     400/s donor, 100/s acceptor
     By 90s, dropped to 200/s donor, 80/s acceptor
     By 230s, dropped to 150/s donor, 60/s acceptor
     Lost at

009: 1um droplet?
     300/s donor, 80/s acceptor
     
010: 1um droplet?
     donor: 300/s decaying to 100/s
     Lost track at t=110s

Increase power to 19uW

011: Decay from lamp for first second
     High count rate for a second or so after lamp died
     Decayed to 120/s donor, 50/s acceptor
     Lost at around t=162s

012: Decay from lamp
     700/s after this
     Lost at t=15s

013: Interesting fluorescence at beginning
     Lost after a few seconds

014: Again, interesting bursty things for first 30 seconds
     Lost at t=100s
