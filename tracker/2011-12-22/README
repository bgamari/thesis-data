Yesterday we reconfigured IR beam to include better control of Z focal point

IR was well aligned last night but today it seems to be quite far off, odd
Realigned

== FRET, 100nM ==

100nM droplets
Ha DNA, Oligo A, D
Trolox, PCD, PCA

Power: donor: 10uW, amp=876

001: Both start at 200/10ms
     Acceptor quickly decays
     Donor decays by t=60s
     Stopped track at t=106s

002: started at D=30/10ms, A=20/10ms
     Changed setpoint.x to 1e-3 at t=59s
     Saw rapid increase in signal, lost track

003: Still with sp.x=1e-3
     Started at A=500/10ms, D=200/10ms
     Normal decay
     Set setpoint.x=0 at t=64s
     Seeing 30/10ms bursts
     Set back to 1e-3 at t=94s
     Played around with y setpoint around t=110s
     No change
     Killed track at t=127s

Let's decrease power to increase dye lifetime
Power: D=1uW (amp=607)
       A=0.55uW (amp=18)

004: Donor: 6 /10ms
     Lost track at t=23s
     Large increase in intensity

005: Nothing here?

006: Definitely see signal of sorts
     Lost at loss of track at t=22s

007: Very low signal
     Played around with X, Y, and Z setpoints
     Fluorescence seemed sensitive to Y
     Lost track at t=65s
     
Realigned visible and IR beams in X and Y

008: Very good track
     A: 15/10ms
     D: 8/10ms
     Acceptor decays, donor grows
     Played around with X and Y setpoints
     Intensity mildly sensitive to both
     Lost track at t=95s

009: Pretty steady fluorescence from both acceptor and donor
     Acceptor decayed slowly
     Played around with all three setpoints
        X: +/-1e-3
        Y: +/-2e-3
        Z: +/-10e-3

010: Had track, tried setting large (8e-3) setpoint, lost track
     Recalibrated, tried to go back into feedback
     Failed to reacquire lock

011: Had good track, strong signal
     Tried changing setpoint, lost track

Giving up on setpoint for now, just using steering mirror to optimize intensity

012: Waiting for acceptor to bleach
     Peker started optimizing intensity at t=575s using donor fluorescence
     Not terribly successful

013: D: 25/10ms
     A: 7/10ms
     Dead acceptor?
     Peker again started optimizing at t=30s
     Stopped around t=50s
     Waiting for donor to bleach
     Lost track at t=160s

Further reducing power

Power: D: 0.2uW, amp=537
       A: 0.12uW, amp=10

014: D: background
     A: 15/10us
     Oops, this is acceptor excitation
     Very slow decrease

015: Continued 014 with donor excitation
     D: 7/10us
     A: Background

016: Continued with 50ms/50ms ALEX
     Turned off donor at t=98 to t=101
     Turned off acceptor just before this, likely dead
     Lost track at 116s

Continuing with 50ms/50ms ALEX

017: Unconvincing signal
     Stopped track at t=52s

018: Much better signal
     See strong acceptor, lower donor
     Acceptor slowly decaying, donor rising
     This datum will be good candidate for further analysis
     Lost track at t=266s

019: No ALEX this time
     Very gradual acceptor decay


== 10uM Oligo A, D ==
New 10uM droplet sample

020: Lamp decay
     Light on at t=8s
     Negligible signal

Increase power
Power: D=1uW, amp=628
       A=0.52uW, amp=19

021: Light on at t=9s
     Fairly weak signal
     A: 9/10ms
     Acceptor dead by t=21s

022: Light on at t=8s
     Donor only?

=== ALEX ===
50ms/50ms ALEX

023: Light on at t=9s
     Definite Acceptor signal
     Died at t=21?
     Difficult to discern donor signal

024: Larger droplet
     Light on at t=9s
     Two molecules?
     One acceptor died at t=24s?
     Second died at t=46s?

025: Light on at t=7s

026: Light on at t=11
     Single molecule?
     Acceptor bleached after only a couple seconds
     
Acceptors are bleaching quite quickly
Let's try adding more PCD, PCA

== Oligo A,D 10nM, more Puglisi, Trolox ==
Same as before but with 5x PCD, PCA, Trolox
Still doing 50ms, 50ms ALEX

027: Larger droplet
     Only donor

028: Light on at t=7s
     Not a very compelling signal, very weak
     Lost track at t=34s

Let's try adding power

Power: D: 1uW, amp=624
       A: 0.5uW, amp=19

029: Donor only, perhaps bleached with accidental high IR intesnsity

030: Light on at t=13s
     Nothing

031: Light on at t=14s
     Donor-only
     Turned up donor to amp=1000 at t=45s
     Three bleach events?

032: Light on at t=14s
     Unclear whether there is signal
     Increased power to 1000 at 44s, lost track at 47s

033: Light on at t=12s
     donor only?
     Set amp=1000 at t=60s
     Lost track at t=72s

Increase power
Power: D: 10uW, amp=885
       A: 5uW, amp=60

034: See strong acceptor for 3 seconds
     Bleaches
     Donor doesn't change appreciable on bleach
     Donor itself eventually bleaches
     Lost track at t=90s

035: Light on at t=12s
     No clear signal

036: Large droplet
     Donor only
     Lost track at t=95s

037: Nothing

038: Donor only

Try looking at droplet adhered to top surface

039: Largish droplet on surface
     t=120s: Turned off donor then acceptor excitation
     It seems that most of the acceptor photons are due to donor excitation, from glass?
     t=153s: 60/10ms burst

We tried collecting photons while exciting glass, see 400/s in acceptor channel, background in donor
