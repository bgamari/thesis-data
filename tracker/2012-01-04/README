== FRET on DNA in droplets ==
Oligo A, D in droplets, slightly less than 10nM
With PCA, PCD, Trolox 
Refer to Peker's FRET notebook 3, pg. 91 for prep.
Tracking
IR laser running at 2.16W

Power: Donor: 0.1uW (amp=122)

001: On at t=6.5s
     Slight acceptor response
     Lost track at t=10s

Power: Donor: 1uW (amp=255)

002: 2um droplet?
     On at t=9s
     Much better acceptor response
     Multiple molecules?
     
003: Empty

004: Empty

005: Empty

006: Definitely something
     Acceptor decayed within a couple seconds
     Stopped feedback at t=62s

007: Empty

008: On at t=9s
     Something but unclear when acceptor died

009: on at t=8.5s
     Signal in acceptor
     Strange burst at t=25s
     Bleach around t=40s?

010: Donor only?

011: Empty

012: Empty

013: On at t=12s
     Sharp signal
     Bleach at t=26s
     Perhaps five bleaches?
     Killed track at t=143s

014: Probably empty

015: Donor only?

016: Lamp decay at t=5s
     Exc. on at t=10s
     Very promising
     Perhaps three bleaches

== Burst ==

Lori suggested looking at bursts from diffusing droplets

30 ticks into solution

50us/50us ALEX
Power: Donor: 10uW (amp=620)
       Acceptor: 5uW (amp=160)

017: Acquired for 15 minutes
     Donor: 50k counts
     Acceptor: 50k counts
     Relatively few bursts

Power: Donor: 20uW (amp=875)
       Acceptor: 10uW (amp=225)

018: Acquired for 15 minutes
     Donor: 60k counts
     Acceptor 57k counts

Seems that we are looking almost exclusively at background

== Buffer bursts ==

Power: Donor: 20uW (amp=875)
       Acceptor: 10uW (amp=225)

019: More bursts than I would have expected
     Surfactant micelles?
     Acquired for 15 minutes
     Donor: 50k counts
     Acceptor: 53k counts

== Oligo D bursts ==

10nM Oligo D

Power: D=20uW, A=10uW

020: Acquired 16 min
     Donor: 59k counts
     Acceptor: 57k counts
