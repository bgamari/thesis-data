Ha oligo A,D 10nM
PCD, PCA, Trolox
Prep in Peker's notes

Power: slightly less than 1uW (amp=430)
Large excitation volume: Excitation beam stopped down

001: Several molecules bleached
     
Power: 1uW (amp=500)

002: Empty

003: Four decays?
     Strong acceptor
     Donor died and then came back intermittently
     Confused

Decreased excitation volume size; opened up excitation beam iris
Power: 5uW (amp=500)

004: Empty

Going to try samples of droplets with glycerine
10% glycerine, PCA, PCD, Trolox, 10nM Oligo A, D

005: Brighter?
     Bleached quickly
     
006: Also much brighter
     Fucked up shit at t=100s
     More fucked up shit at t=135s
     Droplets in vicinity of observation volume?
     Stopped acquisition at t=186s
     No obvious droplets other than one under observation 

007: Bleach at t=14s?
     Strange decreases at t=29, 38s
     Bleached
     Need to reduce power it seems

Power: 0.8uW (amp=300)
008: 4 bleach events
     Very strong acceptor
     Donor seems quite stable
     
009: Empty

010: Two molecules
     
011: Empty

012: Empty

013: Empty

014: Empty

015: Empty

016: Empty

Time for a new sample

== New Sample ==

017: Empty

018: Beautiful
     Two molecules
     First lasted for >5s
     Second bleached at t=29s
     Stopped track at t=55s

019: Single molecule?
     Bleached at t=30s
     Triplet around t=50s?

020: Multiple molecules
     Stopped track t=68s
     
Power: 0.5uW (amp=270)

021: Very weak
     
022: Very nice
     Definitely strong enough signal, decrease further
     Acceptor bleached at t=29s
     Killed track at t=104s

Power: 0.1uW (amp=150)

023: Smaller signal
     Acceptor bleach around t=20s?
     Lost track at t=66s

Let's try ALEX (50us/50us) at higher power

Power: D: 1uW (amp=335)
       A: 0.5uW (amp=58)

024: Something but very weak
     
025: Much better
     Multiple molecules
     Last bleach at t=22s
     Strange bursts until t=70s
     Stopped track at t=100s

026: Bleach at t=23s
     Another at t=29s
     Killed track at t=87s

027: Very intense (40/10ms) for a couple of seconds, bleach
     Donor decays in steps around t=80s
     Died entirely around t=100s
     Lost track around t=125s

== New Sample ==

20% glyercol

Power: 1uW (amp=335)

028: Fairly small signal
     
029: Empty

030: Empty

031: 4um droplet
     Empty or not coupling

Too few droplets

== New sample ==
More dense
20% glycerol

032: Very short and dim signal
     Killed track at t=70s

033: Donor only, brighter
     Killed track at t=34s

034: Good acceptor signal for 5s
     No donor until t=25s
     Weird
     Stopped track at t=51s

035: At least two molecules
     One quickly bleached
     Second bleach at t=23s
     Stopped track at t=81s

036: Empty

037: Lamp decay but otherwise empty

038: Two molecules
     Bleaches at t=15, 18s
     Donor bleach at t=36s, 45s
     Killed track at t=64s

039: Single molecule
     Acceptor decayed after 3s
     Donor decay after 49s
     Killed track at t=60s

Power: 0.5uW (amp=270)

040: Empty

041: Donor only
     Killed track at t=28s

042: Weak signal, perhaps see acceptor bleach

043: Empty or not coupling

044: Donor only
     Killed track at t=23s

045: Decay at t=15s
     Killed track at t=42s

046: Fast bleach
     Delay for donor to come up
     Odd

047: Empty other than lamp decay

048: Two molecules?
     Fast decay

049: Killed track at t=56s

050: Long-lived acceptor
     Single molecule
     No donor after acceptor death?
     Odd.
