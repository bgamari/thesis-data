NOTES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) Based on observation, concentration of FRNA is lower than RRNA. This has been
shown by Sheema using FCS. Here the indicator is that FRNA Donor only bursts are more
sparse than RRNA although they are supposed to have same concentration.

  2) Again from FCS data Sheema took recently, diffusion coefficients of both 16mer 
were very close. Similarly, in FRET Donor only burst hights were similar for both 16mers.
This, i believe, can be taken as confirmation of FCS data.

  3) Additionally, both above results tell us that RNA structures are fine upto 
some degredation. In other words there are definitely nice double helical RNA in both
systems. On the other hand, in FRNA case Cy5 is always dim in fact much dimmer relative
to RRNA. The only easy explanation for that can be Cis-Trans isomerisation of Cy5.

  4) To test the idea in NOTE 3, following the Trolox paper (T. J. Ha, Nature Methods)
I applied 532nm light on to samples by using fluorimeter. Even though, they were not  
systematic, Cy5 counts increased. Therefore i will try to play with this method for 
making it little bit optimized.
