NOTES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) In parallel to Lori's advice, i used 1nM samples for Forward attached
RNA 16mer. In fact i felt like it was little more crowded. I think it will
be more clear when we analyze it.

  2) In this sample, there was (probably) an aggregate around 14 minutes.
I previously thought that with the addition of less Trolox i might not have
those kind of junk in sample. Unfortunately, as i pointed out, this sample
broke this idea. Therefore i am not taking remaining Trolox included samples'
data.
