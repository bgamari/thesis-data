Dark Counts in detectors : A/D ~ 40/40 per sec
Alignment Check with 100 nM TMR with 50uW 514nm . Counts : D/A ~ 245k/32k per sec
Always 30 tics up into solution
Always wells used and covered with Sigmacote
Trolox concentration is always 2mM
Effective glycerol solution in usage of 5% Glycerol for FRNA is 2.5%, for RRNA 3.6%

Throughout FRET experiments iris was closed and back-aperture of objective lens
was underfilling. 

In droplet experiments iris was fully opened and presumably diffraction limited spot used 
as excitation volume. 

In droplet data 5uL PCD (150x) + 20uL PCA (40x) + 4uL Trolox (100x) added to 100uL sample 
In droplet data MIX solution always CO2 treated

NOTES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) Upon Lori's suggestion i used only single color excitation throughout
the FRET solution experiments.

  2) Again, following Lori's other suggestion i underfilled the back-aperture of
objective lens by closing down the iris which placed at the collimated part of
excitation beam. Throughout the experiment it was fully closed but not forced to
go smaller opening.

  3) Before sarting new samples i decided to replace one of the filters in
front of Red APD (ET 690/50m Band Pass) with another one (BLP01-635R-25 Long Pass).
For further comments Please check FRET NOTEBOOK IV (PEKER) page 16-17 (Belongs to yesterday!!! 
Included for continuity).

  4) Whenever i added Trolox to solution there were almost always slow diffusing
aggregate like stuff in live plot of data. This is one of those.
