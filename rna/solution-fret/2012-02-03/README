NOTES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) Apparently all the solutions even stock solutions were dirty. The severity of 
contamination was in the following order; Glycerol, Sucrose, Hepes, MgCl2, Tween 20,
and NaCl. Fortunatelywater is very clean.

  2) Therefore i prepared all solutions from either powder or crystals. From now on
we decided to not oreder any kind of liquid solutions. We will always start from solid 
phase of chemicals we use. In parallel, the results belong to preps from solid form
are very clear. They start from run_015 and ends at run_019
