NOTES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) FRNA is from last Friday. I prepared dilutions starting from 
1uM samples.

  2) In this set of samples i believe i had a concentration issue. 
Bursts were really and unexpectedly rare.

  3) Bursts are sparse and sort of implies that i had again a 
concentration issue. Unfortunately i have no idea why that did happen.
