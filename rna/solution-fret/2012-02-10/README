NOTES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) Buffer counts somehow increased. In fact i figured out the reason
in next experiment. It was probably because of BSA remnants in wells.

  2) I forgot to dump records to file. Therefore i took this data after
run_015.

  3) According to "Carbocyanine Dyes as Efficient Reversible Single-Molecule
Optical Switch" by Mike Heilemann, Emmanuel Margeat, Robert Kasper, Markus Sauer,
 and Philip Tinnefeld, application of either 532nm or 488nm recovers the 
isomerized Cy5 meanwhile Trolox and MV need to be present in solution.
Interestingly there was only the result of 488nm application in one of the 
graphs in the paper. Therefore i applied those lines in presence of EVIL4.

  4) Because of very high counts, most probably contamination, i stopped 
taking data on Donor only systems.
