NOTES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) Apparently we had a background problem in those experiments. From live plots of
data DEPC-water, 10% Glycerol solution in DEPC-water, and NaCl solution in DEPC-water
were clean. On the other hand MgCl2 solution in DEPC-water, 10-4 Tween 20 solution in 
DEPC-water, and Hepes were most probably contaminated.

  2) As it has been explained in lab notebook, FRET 3 NOTEBOOK (PEKER) pages 160-162
i took a UV-Vis data on annealed products. Apparently measured concentrations for both 
FRNA DA and FRNA D have lower concentrations. The range for RNA samples are probably
some where between 10-25% of expected concentrations. For further info, Please see the
notebook.
