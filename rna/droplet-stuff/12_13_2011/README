NOTES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) I asked Ben to move up the stage some amount after 40-45 mins, because we knew that
droplets will migrate up. He did it but apparently he didn't dump the records into a new file.
In fact, after he changed the position of sample, he didn't write down the time and the 
new position. Therefore i decided to take this data again in run_002 and run_003.
  2) As a common property for all samples, most of the droplets produced high Donor bursts.
On the other hand, whenever a burst appears in Acceptor channel without a burst in Donor channel
(this is by eye from live plot of bins), it was really distinct and easily identifiable.
