--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For additional notes and corrections/comments on data PLEASE, See the notes end of the document


Quick Nomenclature: 
------------------------------------
SAMPLE : RNA in buffer + PCD/PCA + Trolox mixture before droplet prep
DENSE : Original emulsion right after sonication. Content is 200uL, 10^-3 (v/v) RainDance in FC40 + 5uL RNA sample
MIX : Diluted emulsion in oil without extra surfactant, often times Emulsion/Oil (v/v) is around 1/4
Buffer: 20mM Hepes pH 7.8 + 50mM NaCl + 5mM MgCl2 + "PCD/PCA + Trolox + MV" -> As described below
Forward Attached RNA 16mer (FRNA DA): Double strand FRET pair (Cy3,Cy5) labeled RNA 16mer
Forward Attached RNA 16mer Donor Only (FRNA D): Double strand Only Donor labeled (Cy3) RNA 16mer
Reverse Attached RNA 16mer (RRNA DA): Double strand FRET pair (Cy3,Cy5) labeled RNA 16mer
Reverse Attached RNA 16mer Donor Only (RRNA D): Double strand Only Donor labeled (Cy3) RNA 16mer

ALEX50: 50usec alternation time, 50uW 514nm and 25uW 647nm
ALEX20: 50usec alternation time, 20uW 514nm and 10uW 647nm
Non-ALEX50: Only 50uW 514nm
Non-ALEX20: Only 20uW 514nm

Fully Closed Iris (FCI): The Smallest beam diameter in collimated region so Under-filling Objective Lens
Fully Opened Iris (FOI): The Largest beam diameter in collimated region so Critically-filling Objective Lens

Dark Counts in detectors : A/D ~ 40/40 per sec
Alignment Check with 100 nM old TMR with 30uW 514nm . Counts : D/A ~ 90k/12k per sec

Always 30 tics up into solution
Always dissolve CO2 in MIX oil before adding droplets from DENSE
Always add 2uL PCD (150x), 5uL PCA (40x), 1uL Trolox (100x), 1uL Methyl Viologen (MV) (100x) into 100L buffer first. 
Then add RNA sample for dilution into this solution. This is again before DENSE prep.

NOTES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) RNA samples are from yesterday's 1uM samples. I kept them in ice.

  2) I am intended to check this Back-Isomerization mechanism today. Previously
on 2012-03-08 data, i observed that surfactant fluoresces by the application of
488nm light. On the other hand, it was fairly quite for 476nm. Therefore i decided
to apply 476nm for triggering back-isomerization. Having said that, it was also very
surprising to see very long Stokes shift in the surfactant fluorescence. More
explicitly, surfactant absorbes 488nm and emits around 676nm (peak emission wavelength
of Cy5). This suggests that surfactant (RainDance) most probably have a cyclic structure
in its hydrophobic head, also tells the possibility of having at least one aromatic ring
in the same part of the molecule.
 
  3) Here 476nm line is supposed to be slightly defocused because of chromatic aberration
of the objective lens.
