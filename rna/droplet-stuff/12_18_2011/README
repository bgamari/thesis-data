Droplet Making Tune-up Experiments
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1mL FC77 1% RainDance solution diluted 2 times. Now it is 0.5% RainDanece in FC770


Sample 1:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) 10-20 secs shaking 
  2) Sonicate 5 mins to form DENSE 
  3) Specified amount of DENSE (as described below) into 200uL FC770 to form MIX

  Pic 1: 10uL DENSE into 200uL FC770, 1a.ppm
  Pic 2: 5uL DENSE into 200uL FC770, 1b.ppm
  Pic 3: 2uL DENSE into 200uL FC770, 1c.ppm

NOTES:
  1) DENSE solution is homogenous. No clear seperation.
  2) Small size droplets as in 1% RainDance samples.
  3) DENSE solution is stable for hours.
  4) FC770 evaporates very fast, so sample cell needs to be 
sealed very well.


Sample 2:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) 10-20 secs shaking 
  2) Sonicate 4 mins to form DENSE 
  3) Specified amount of DENSE (as described below) into 200uL FC770 to form MIX

  Pic 1: 10uL DENSE (from hazy bottom part) into 200uL FC770, 2a.ppm
  Pic 2: Only DENSE (from hazy bottom part, removed top part), 2b.ppm
  Pic 3: 50uL DENSE (from hazy bottom part, removed top part) into 200uL FC770, 2c.ppm

NOTES:
  1) DENSE solution was not homogenous. There were clearly two parts.
One at top was white and dense. Other at bottom was hazy.
  2) After 5 mins or so DENSE solution seperated into three parts.
One at top was white and dense. At middle there was a hazy part. Finally
at the bottom, there was a clear part. 
  3) I removed the white dense top part by using a pipette. Remaining stuff
was mostly hazy and clear ones. On the other hand, they can easily mix
just by a small disturbance.
  4) Droplets from hazy part move to top surface very quickly.
  5) Hard to tell about the stability of solution, especially after removing 
the top dense white cloud. But the lower limit will be something like 2 hours.


Sample 3:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) 10-20 secs shaking 
  2) Sonicate 3 mins to form DENSE 
  3) Specified amount of DENSE (as described below) into 200uL FC770 to form MIX

  Pic 1: 50uL DENSE into 200uL FC770, 3a.ppm
  Pic 2: 50uL DENSE into 200uL FC770, big droplets, 3b.ppm
  Pic 3: 50uL DENSE into 200uL FC770, one of the biggest droplets, 3c.ppm

NOTES:
  1) DENSE solution was not homogenous. There were clearly three parts.
One at top was white and dense. At middle there was a hazy part. Finally
at the bottom, there was a clear part. 
  2) Seperation of above parts was different than 5 mins old Sample 2.
This time top (white and dense) part was thinner. Size of middle one 
(hazy) was simlar to the size of bottom part (clear). 
  3) Hard to tell about the stability of solution. But the lower limit 
will be something like 2 hours.
  4) Big and stable droplets observed in solution. Some of them were 
couple of times bigger than the apparent size of the focused laser beam
in solution.
