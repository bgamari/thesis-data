NOTES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) In all data sets there are fluorescence from RainDance into both channels.
The highest count rates observed is around 100 counts per 10ms. This says that in actual
experiment we can only be sure about the extreme counts rates so that we can tell they are 
from fluorophores. Other than that, roughly speaking, we have somewhere in between 10-15%
RainDance fluorescence in both channels for each fluorescent experiment, according to total 
counts. This can further be shown by looking at the increase (somehow proportional) in 
fluorescence with increasing water droplet density in oil.

  2) According to rough estimate of dark counts, in 53 mins, we should have had 143k/127k
photons as D/A channels. Here in run_003 what we got is slightly more than that. In other 
words, approximate background counts are around 63/63 per sec.I think this is an acceptable
fluorescence from the sample for single molecule experiments.
