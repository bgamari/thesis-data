NOTES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) Buffer consists of 20mM pH 7.8 Hepes + 10% Glycerol in DEPC water + 50mM NaCl

  2) DENSE droplet solution prepared in FC40. MIX prepared as diluting DENSE 1:4 ratio
in FC770

  3) We previously used FC70 as a viscous bath for slowing down the droplets. Again in previous 
experiments we were making droplets in FC770 which is 4-5 times less viscous than FC40 and almost 2 
times less viscous than Water. In current experiments we made our droplets in FC40. Therefore, when
we put them into FC70 bath by MIX they sort of hanged in the solution without moving much. As a result
all MIX runs (run_005, and run_007) gave us almost background signal.

  4) Starting from 40X PCA, 150X PCD, and 100X Trolox all as described in FRET NOTEBOOK 3 (PEKER) page 1,
we added them into OligoD solution as following. For 100uL OligoD solution, 5uL PCD, 10uL PCA, and 
4uL Trolox. This info documented in page 72 of FRET NOTEBOOK 3 (PEKER).

  5) This maybe just an eye issue but after the addition of PCD/PCA+Trolox droplets kind of shrinked. 
In other words we kind of got some slightly smaller and denser emulsions.

  6) Because we got a small signal in 10nM experiments, we decided to increase the concentration to 100nM.
Also in run_009, to make diluted droplets in tightly hanged in solution we decided to use FC40 rather than 
FC70 as bath.
