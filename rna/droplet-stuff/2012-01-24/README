NOTES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) Somehow Donor only samples had less counts than expected. This reminds me the 
possibility of a stability issue of Cy3. It has been reported that Trolox works well
on Cy5 but its effect is not as pronounced in Cy3 case. It has also been reported in 
another paper that in the absence of O2 Trolox can not dissociate to its oxidizing
form. Therefore i think because of lack of oxidizing form of Trolox Cy3 is not stable 
enough. On the other hand this can be an indicator of RNA itself is an oxidizing agent
in the system in the following way. From MD simulations Cy5 is supposed to be base
stacked almost all time. If only Trolox as reducing agent works RNA should be oxidizing
agent for Cy5. This is the observed case i believe not in this specific experiment but
in all other surface experiments too. In parallel, from MD, Cy3 is not like Cy5 and it 
has other possible configurations at the end of RNA, and so RNA may not be able to 
oxidize Cy3 as efficiently as Cy5.   

  2) Buffer in this experiment consists of 20mM Hepes pH 7.8 + 50mM NaCl + 5mM MgCl2
