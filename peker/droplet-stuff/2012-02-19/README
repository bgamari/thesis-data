FRET on RNA 16mer Forward and Reverse Attachments in Diffusing Droplets 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For additional notes and corrections/comments on data PLEASE, See the notes end of the document


Quick Nomenclature: 
------------------------------------
SAMPLE : RNA in buffer + PCD/PCA + Trolox mixture before droplet prep
DENSE : Original emulsion right after sonication
MIX : Diluted emulsion in oil without extra surfactant, often times Emulsion/Oil (v/v) is around 1/4
Buffer: 20mM Hepes pH 7.8 + 50mM NaCl + 5mM MgCl2 + "PCD/PCA + Trolox + MV" -> As described below
Forward Attached RNA 16mer (FRNA DA): Double strand FRET pair (Cy3,Cy5) labeled RNA 16mer
Forward Attached RNA 16mer Donor Only (FRNA D): Double strand Only Donor labeled (Cy3) RNA 16mer
Reverse Attached RNA 16mer (RRNA DA): Double strand FRET pair (Cy3,Cy5) labeled RNA 16mer
Reverse Attached RNA 16mer Donor Only (RRNA D): Double strand Only Donor labeled (Cy3) RNA 16mer

ALEX50: 50usec alternation time, 50uW 514nm and 25uW 647nm
ALEX20: 50usec alternation time, 20uW 514nm and 10uW 647nm
Non-ALEX50: Only 50uW 514nm
Non-ALEX20: Only 20uW 514nm

Dark Counts in detectors : A/D ~ 40/40 per sec
Alignment Check with 100 nM old TMR with 50uW 514nm . Counts : D/A ~ 240k/32k per sec

Always 30 tics up into solution
Always dissolve CO2 in MIX oil before adding droplets from DENSE
Always add 1uL PCD (150x), 5uL PCA (40x), 1uL Trolox (100x), 1uL Methyl Viologen (MV) (100x) into 100uL RNA sample before DENSE prep

NOTES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) 2-0.2uL pipette had an issue with its tip. Sometimes tip
was locking to the pipette. I notced that in the prep of run_009.
Therefore samples before run_009 may not have one or more 1uL 
buffer components. Those are PCD, Trolox, and MV.
