NOTES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) Data looks similar to last RNA data in freely diffusing droplets. More specifically
,by eye, frequancy of Donor bursts and Acceptor bursts are similar. Again very high counts
per 10msec (around 400 sometimes) in Donor channel. On the other hand, in same time intervals
Acceptor could go up tp 150-200 in the absence of Donor bursts. By this i meant, those are 
the bursts that we clearly don't expect them from Donor leakage by looking at live plot.

  2) In this sample at least once i observed 400 photons per 10msec in Acceptor channel as a 
burst without simultaneous Donor burst in live plot.

  3) Droplets have 100nM HaDNA, PCD/PCA, and Trolox in them. For more details of preparation,
See FRET NOTEBOOK 3 (PEKER) pages 24

  4) A slight increase is observed in total Acceptor counts. In parallel a slight decrese is
observed in total Donor counts. Also at least one 500 per 10msec Acceptor burst is observed.
Finally, seems like a slight increase in frequency of Acceptor bursts is observed

  5) Somehow when i go up to 50 tics, there is almost always a slight decrease in total counts. I 
don't understand the reason for this

  6) Two kind of droplets. One has 100nM HaDNA+Trolox in them. The other has PCD/PCA in them. For 
more details of preparation, See FRET NOTEBOOK 3 (PEKER) pages 24

  7) In the MIX droplet solution, which is the dilution in FC70, 10uL HaDNA droplets (as always)
and 20uL PCD/PCA droplets, For more details of preparation, See FRET NOTEBOOK 3 (PEKER) pages 24,26

  8) No clear increase in background signal, but somehow slight in crease in Acceptor bursts sizes.
This comment is relative to data run_002

  9) 10uL HaDNA+Trolox and 50uL PCD/PCA DENSE droplet solutions added to previous MIX (dilution in FC70) 
solution. This was the droplet solution for run_004 and run_005. Here it supposed to be more 
concentrated by means of total HaDNA droplets, as well as non-emitting PCD/PCA droplets even more

  10) Especially in run_006 and run_007 there are some droplets with similar emission profiles as
 Lori's trapped droplets. I mean an Acceptor burst followed by strong Donor bursts while droplet 
is presumably in observation volume. I can even further tell those kind of droplet appeared in run_004
and run_005
