NOTES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) Buffer consists of 20mM pH 7.8 Hepes + 10% Glycerol in DEPC water + 50mM NaCl + 5mM MgCl2

  2) DENSE droplet solution prepared in FC40. MIX prepared as diluting DENSE 1:4 ratio
either in FC770 or FC40 as reported in ruyn specs.

  3) Because I had less counts than i expected, i decided to repeat run_012. I used same
DENSE and i prepared a new MIX. I took the sample from this new MIX.

  4) Interestingly singly labeled RNA was not as bright as i was expecting. Only in relatively
higher concentrations i got some clear increase in total Donor counts.

  5) As it can be seen in picture from run_017, i have clearly smaller size droplets. Roughly
speaking, their radius is probably atleast 2 times smaller than the ones we were tracking.
Considering we decided that we reached the single molecule concentration in tracking by
using 10nM concentration, i believe i should start to see single molecule FRET around 20mM
or higher concentration. In fact, 2 times smaller droplet radius makes the single molecule
concentration 2^3=8 times larger. I think is a very important point in those experiments.
