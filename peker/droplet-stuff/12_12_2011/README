Dark Counts in detectors : A/D ~ 40/45 per sec
Alignment Check with 100 nM Cy3 labelled Ha's OligoD with 10-11 uW 514nm . Counts : A/D ~ 120k/15k per sec
Never Track never Trap, no IR

run_000:
-------------------------------------------------
  1) 100nM Ha's Cy3 labelled Ha's OligoD in freely diffusing droplets
  2) 20 ticks up into solution
  3) Relatively denser than last data set from last Friday (12/9/2011)
  4) Stopped around 2 mins for checking the density by eye

run_001:
-------------------------------------------------
  1) On same sample in run_000
  2) 20 ticks up into solution
  3) Only 514nm excitation 10-11 uW
  4) Around 45 mins, total ~ 350k Donor counts
  5) Rare Acceptor bursts, probably because of old PCA  

run_002:
-------------------------------------------------
  1) On same sample in run_000 and run_001
  2) Considering the migration of droplets up in time, 50 ticks up into solution
  3) Only 514nm excitation 10-11 uW
  4) Around 45 mins, total ~ 350k Donor counts
  5) Rare Acceptor bursts, probably because of old PCA

run_003:
-------------------------------------------------
  1) New sample cell from 100nM droplet stock
  2) 20 ticks up into solution
  3) Only 514nm excitation 23 uW
  4) Around 60 mins, total ~ 850k Donor counts
  5) Rare Acceptor bursts, probably because of old PCA

run_004:
-------------------------------------------------
  1) On same sample in run_003
  2) Considering the migration of droplets up in time, 50 ticks up into solution
  3) Only 514nm excitation 23 uW
  4) Around 60 mins, total ~ 700k Donor counts
  5) Rare Acceptor bursts, probably because of old PCA

run_005:
-------------------------------------------------
  1) 50nM Ha's Cy3 labelled Ha's OligoD in freely diffusing droplets
  2) This time 50uL of solution into FC77+RainDance to have a less dense droplet sample
  3) 20 ticks up into solution
  4) Only 514nm excitation 23 uW
  5) Around 60 mins, total ~ 400k Donor counts
  6) Rare Acceptor bursts, probably because of old PCA

run_006:
-------------------------------------------------
  1) On same sample in run_005
  3) Considering the migration of droplets up in time, 50 ticks up into solution
  4) Only 514nm excitation 23 uW
  5) Around 75 mins, total ~ 450k Donor counts
  6) Rare Acceptor bursts, probably because of old PCA

run_007:
-------------------------------------------------
  1) 10nM Ha's Cy3 labelled Ha's OligoD in freely diffusing droplets
  2) This time 50uL of solution into FC77+RainDance to have a less dense droplet sample
  3) 20 ticks up into solution
  4) Only 514nm excitation 23 uW
  5) Around 60 mins, total ~ 315k Donor counts
  6) Rare Acceptor bursts, probably because of old PCA
