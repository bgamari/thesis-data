-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For additional notes and corrections/comments on data PLEASE, See the notes end of the document


Quick Nomenclature: 
------------------------------------
DENSE : Original emulsion right after sonication
MIX : Diluted emulsion in oil without extra surfactant, often times Emulsion/Oil (v/v) is around 1/4
RNA 16mer : Double strand FRET pair (Cy3,Cy5) labeled RNA 16mer
RNA 16mer Donor Only: Double strand Only Donor labeled (Cy3) RNA 16mer

Dark Counts in detectors : A/D ~ 40/40 per sec
Alignment Check with 100 nM Cy3 labelled Ha's OligoD with 10uW 514nm . Counts : D/A ~ 171k/21k per sec
Always ALEX with 50us alternation time
Always 10uW 514nm and 5uW 647nm 
Always 30 tics up into solution
Always 10% Glycerol in buffer solution

density_size_005.ppm

NOTES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) In this experiment RNA sample was 2 days old. Although i kept it ice, I am
expecting to see some degredation/melting in sample. Therefore it may be safer to
consider those concentrations as 90-80% of their reported values.
