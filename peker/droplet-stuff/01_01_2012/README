-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For additional notes and corrections/comments on data PLEASE, See the notes end of the document


Quick Nomenclature: 
------------------------------------
DENSE : Original emulsion right after sonication, as explained in page 85 of PEKER FRET 3 NOTEBOOK
MIX : Diluted emulsion in oil without extra surfactant, often times Emulsion/Oil (v/v) is around 1/4

Dark Counts in detectors : A/D ~ 40/45 per sec
Alignment Check with 100 nM Cy3 labelled Ha's OligoD with 10uW 514nm . Counts : D/A ~ 270k/35k per sec
Always 30 tics up into solution
