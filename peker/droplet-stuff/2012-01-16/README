NOTES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) Buffer consists of 20mM pH 7.8 Hepes + 10% Glycerol in DEPC water + 50mM NaCl

  2) DENSE droplet solution prepared in FC40. MIX prepared as diluting DENSE 1:4 ratio
in FC770

  3) Oligo D concentrations can be taken as somewhere between 80-90% of reported 
concentration, because of pipetting and vaporization of sample in time.
