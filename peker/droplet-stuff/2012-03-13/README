Reverse Attached RNA 16mer (RRNA DA): Double strand FRET pair (Cy3,Cy5) labeled RNA 16mer
Reverse Attached RNA 16mer Donor Only (RRNA D): Double strand Only Donor labeled (Cy3) RNA 16mer

ALEX50: 50usec alternation time, 50uW 514nm and 25uW 647nm
ALEX20: 50usec alternation time, 20uW 514nm and 10uW 647nm
Non-ALEX50: Only 50uW 514nm
Non-ALEX20: Only 20uW 514nm

Fully Closed Iris (FCI): The Smallest beam diameter in collimated region so Under-filling Objective Lens
Fully Opened Iris (FOI): The Largest beam diameter in collimated region so Critically-filling Objective Lens

Dark Counts in detectors : A/D ~ 40/40 per sec
Alignment Check with 100 nM old TMR with 40uW 514nm . Counts : D/A ~ 100k/13k per sec

Always 30 tics up into solution
Always dissolve CO2 in MIX oil before adding droplets from DENSE
Always add 2uL PCD (150x), 5uL PCA (40x), 1uL Trolox (100x), 1uL Methyl Viologen (MV) (100x) into 100L buffer first. 
Then add RNA sample for dilution into this solution. This is again before DENSE prep.

NOTES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) This time i used a slightly different sonication method. Basically,
I shaked the solution for DENSE, then i put it into a conical with ice in it.
I sonicated this for 2 mins. Without opening conical, i shaked it, then i 
sonicated it another 2 mins. 

  2) Here 476nm line is supposed to be slightly defocused because of chromatic aberration
of the objective lens.

  3) This sample is the same sample as 008. I didn't change objective lens' position.
I just kept everything as they were, i turned on 476nm and record the data to anew file.

  4) I ran out of PCD. Therefore i prepared this sample with a fresh PCD from -80 C.
  
  5) This sample is the same sample as 010. I didn't change objective lens' position.
I just kept everything as they were, i turned on 476nm and record the data to anew file.

  6) I forgot to turn on 476nm at the beginning. I turned it on after 7-8 mins. Then i 
recorded the data to same file (011).
