FRET on RNA 16mer Forward Attachment in Diffusing Droplets 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For additional notes and corrections/comments on data PLEASE, See the notes end of the document


Quick Nomenclature: 
------------------------------------
SAMPLE : RNA in buffer + PCD/PCA + Trolox mixture before droplet prep
DENSE : Original emulsion right after sonication. Content is 200uL, 10^-3 (v/v) RainDance in FC40 + 5uL RNA sample
MIX : Diluted emulsion in oil without extra surfactant, often times Emulsion/Oil (v/v) is around 1/4
Buffer: 20mM Hepes pH 7.8 + 50mM NaCl + 5mM MgCl2 + "PCD/PCA + Trolox + MV" -> As described below
Forward Attached RNA 16mer (FRNA DA): Double strand FRET pair (Cy3,Cy5) labeled RNA 16mer
Forward Attached RNA 16mer Donor Only (FRNA D): Double strand Only Donor labeled (Cy3) RNA 16mer
Reverse Attached RNA 16mer (RRNA DA): Double strand FRET pair (Cy3,Cy5) labeled RNA 16mer
Reverse Attached RNA 16mer Donor Only (RRNA D): Double strand Only Donor labeled (Cy3) RNA 16mer

ALEX50: 50usec alternation time, 50uW 514nm and 25uW 647nm
ALEX20: 50usec alternation time, 20uW 514nm and 10uW 647nm
Non-ALEX50: Only 50uW 514nm
Non-ALEX20: Only 20uW 514nm

Fully Closed Iris (FCI): The Smallest beam diameter in collimated region so Under-filling Objective Lens
Fully Opened Iris (FOI): The Largest beam diameter in collimated region so Critically-filling Objective Lens

Dark Counts in detectors : A/D ~ 40/40 per sec
Alignment Check with 100 nM old TMR with 30uW 514nm . Counts : D/A ~ 90k/12k per sec

Always 30 tics up into solution
Always dissolve CO2 in MIX oil before adding droplets from DENSE
Always add 2uL PCD (150x), 5uL PCA (40x), 1uL Trolox (100x), 1uL Methyl Viologen (MV) (100x) into 100L buffer first. 
Then add RNA sample for dilution into this solution. This is again before DENSE prep.

NOTES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) Here i tried to apply 2uW constant 488nm excitation in addition to 514nm excitation to the sample
for possibly recovering some of isomerized Cy5. Unfortunately, surfactant (more likely) gloves by application
of 488nm. Fluorescence observed mostly in Acceptor channel. Counts were roughly 40photons/10msec in Acceptor
channel. There was no dramatic change in Donor channel counts
