FRET on RNA 16mer Forward and Reverse Attachments in Diffusing Droplets 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For additional notes and corrections/comments on data PLEASE, See the notes end of the document


Quick Nomenclature: 
------------------------------------
SAMPLE : RNA in buffer + PCD/PCA + Trolox mixture before droplet prep
DENSE : Original emulsion right after sonication. Content is 200uL, 10^-3 (v/v) RainDance in FC40 + 5uL RNA sample
MIX : Diluted emulsion in oil without extra surfactant, often times Emulsion/Oil (v/v) is around 1/4
Buffer: 20mM Hepes pH 7.8 + 50mM NaCl + 5mM MgCl2 + "PCD/PCA + Trolox + MV" -> As described below
Forward Attached RNA 16mer (FRNA DA): Double strand FRET pair (Cy3,Cy5) labeled RNA 16mer
Forward Attached RNA 16mer Donor Only (FRNA D): Double strand Only Donor labeled (Cy3) RNA 16mer
Reverse Attached RNA 16mer (RRNA DA): Double strand FRET pair (Cy3,Cy5) labeled RNA 16mer
Reverse Attached RNA 16mer Donor Only (RRNA D): Double strand Only Donor labeled (Cy3) RNA 16mer

ALEX50: 50usec alternation time, 50uW 514nm and 25uW 647nm
ALEX20: 50usec alternation time, 20uW 514nm and 10uW 647nm
Non-ALEX50: Only 50uW 514nm
Non-ALEX20: Only 20uW 514nm

Fully Closed Iris (FCI): The Smallest beam diameter in collimated region so Under-filling Objective Lens
Fully Opened Iris (FOI): The Largest beam diameter in collimated region so Critically-filling Objective Lens

Dark Counts in detectors : A/D ~ 40/40 per sec
Alignment Check with 100 nM old TMR with 30uW 514nm . Counts : D/A ~ 88k/11k per sec

Always 30 tics up into solution
Always dissolve CO2 in MIX oil before adding droplets from DENSE
Always add 2uL PCD (150x), 5uL PCA (40x), 1uL Trolox (100x), 1uL Methyl Viologen (MV) (100x) into 100L buffer first. 
Then add RNA sample for dilution into this solution. This is again before DENSE prep.

NOTES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) I should say this is a note on general behavior of dyes. From some readings on 
perfluorinated compounds, i realized that some cyclic compounds can involve into charge
transfer business. Although i am kind of confused with classification, those compounds
interacts with hydrocarbons with conjugated chains as either reducer or oxydizer. BUT
just one these not one or the other i meant!!! Also from other readings, i realized that
glycerol does two things. First, it promotes back-isomerization while reduces the rate of 
isomerization.Second it likes to stay close to interfaces. As a summary of all above info
i started to think about that glycerol may hinder the interaction of surfactant with 
any of dyes and so makes them more well-behaved. We definitely need to check this!!!
