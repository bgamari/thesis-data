NOTES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) Upon Lori's suggestion i used only single color excitation throughout
the whole experiment.

  2) Again, following Lori's other suggestion i underfilled the back-aperture of
objective lens by closing down the iris which placed at the collimated part of
excitation beam. Throughout the experiment it was fully closed but not forced to
go smaller opening.

  3) Before sarting new samples i decided to replace one of the filters in
front of Red APD (ET 690/50m Band Pass) with another one (BLP01-635R-25 Long Pass).
For further comments Please check FRET NOTEBOOK IV (PEKER) page 16-17 (Belongs to yesterday!!! 
Included for continuity).

  4) Whenever i added Trolox to solution there were almost always slow diffusing
aggregate like stuff in live plot of data. This is one of those.

  5) Before sarting new samples i decided to realign Red APD. For further 
comments Please check FRET NOTEBOOK IV (PEKER) page 16-17.(Belongs to yesterday!!! 
Included for continuity).
