Quick Nomenclature: 
------------------------------------
SAMPLE : RNA in buffer + PCD/PCA + Trolox mixture before droplet prep
DENSE : Original emulsion right after sonication
MIX : Diluted emulsion in oil without extra surfactant, often times Emulsion/Oil (v/v) is around 1/4

Buffer for solution: 20mM Hepes pH 7.8 + 50mM NaCl + 5mM MgCl2 
Buffer for droplets: 20mM Hepes pH 7.8 + 50mM NaCl + 5mM MgCl2 + "PCD/PCA + Trolox + MV" -> As described below

Forward Attached RNA 16mer (FRNA DA): Double strand FRET pair (Cy3,Cy5) labeled RNA 16mer
Forward Attached RNA 16mer Donor Only (FRNA D): Double strand Only Donor labeled (Cy3) RNA 16mer
Reverse Attached RNA 16mer (RRNA DA): Double strand FRET pair (Cy3,Cy5) labeled RNA 16mer
Reverse Attached RNA 16mer Donor Only (RRNA D): Double strand Only Donor labeled (Cy3) RNA 16mer

ALEX50: 50usec alternation time, 50uW 514nm and 25uW 647nm
ALEX20: 50usec alternation time, 20uW 514nm and 10uW 647nm
Non-ALEX50: Only 50uW 514nm
Non-ALEX20: Only 20uW 514nm
Non-ALEX10: Only 10uW 514nm

Fully Closed Iris (FCI): The Smallest beam diameter in collimated region so Under-filling Objective Lens
Fully Opened Iris (FOI): The Largest beam diameter in collimated region so Critically-filling Objective Lens

Dark Counts in detectors : A/D ~ 40/40 per sec
Alignment Check with 100 nM old TMR with 50uW 514nm . Counts : D/A ~ 240k/32k per sec

Always 30 tics up into solution
Always dissolve CO2 in MIX oil before adding droplets from DENSE
Always add 1uL PCD (150x), 5uL PCA (40x), 1uL Trolox (100x), 1uL Methyl Viologen (MV) (100x) into 100uL RNA sample before DENSE prep

NOTES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) Here i used new glycerol in a conical prepared by Sheema. It is supposed to have 
no contamination in it. Unfortunately this 10% solution was gloving. Fluorescence from
it is not just an elevation in the signal (like increase in background in a uniform way)
but also i observed some spikes or better bursts in signal.

  2) At this point of experiment i removed the excitation filter. I also checked the 
purity of the signal by measuring the power (before microscope) before and after removal
of filter. Looks like we were getting a nice clean 514nm line out of AOTF (upto 99%).
