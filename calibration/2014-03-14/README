004     10nM TMR, 100uW @ 488
005     10nM TMR after 5 min in sonicator, 100uW
006     Same sample as 005, 200uW
007     Again
008     400uW
note    Noticed large clumps diffusing in brightfield
009     Fresh 100nM TMR sample prepared by Anand, 100uW
010     Again
011     200uW
012     Again
013     Again
014     Again
015     Again
016     Uncorrelated ambient light for afterpulsing correction
