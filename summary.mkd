## 2015-03-19: Examining OG514 triplet/bleaching via FCS

 * Motivated by RNA experiments, low counts in pH lifetime measurements in droplets
 * Clearly see triplet appear at high powers
 * Tried Phosphate 7.5, Citrate 4.0, and Citrate 3.0 buffers, no clear difference?

## 2015-03-18: Trying photophysical soups

## 2015-03-17: Droplet pH with OG488 and BCECF

 * A complete set of droplet lifetime measurements
 * Very low counts, fluorescence quickly decays
 * Oscillated view back and forth to elicit more counts, perhaps characterize decay lifetime
 
## 2015-03-13: DLS on extruded droplets

## 2015-03-12: FCS on Extruded droplets

 * Trying out extruder
 * Very nice correlation functions
 
## 2015-03-02: Calibration on BCECF 

 * New SiO2 for IRF

 * This is likely a better concentration for FCS

## 2015-02-19: droplet FCS as a function of surfactant concentration

 * Repeating experiments of 10 Feb 2015 and 12 Feb 2015 but switching
   to Coherent laser due to poor stability of Melles-Griot
